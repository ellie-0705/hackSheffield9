## She HACK on my A till i THON!!

A project created during hackSheffield9, hosted by the University of Sheffield's Computer Science Society, by:
* [Neehru](https://github.com/neehru)
* [Nicole](https://github.com/nmurch)
* [Ellie](https://github.com/ellie-0705)
* [Thomas](https://github.com/gheist404)

The project aimed to create a site where users could draw music notes, and then an audio file would be made based on the predicted notes.
We made this using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the webpage and Python scripts for the more technical backend processing. Although we didn't manage to finish merging these files by the end of the 24-hour hackathon (partly due to impromptu 11 p.m. bingo, a trip to the train station, and random Windows updates), all the separate functionality was completed.
We then worked on fixing the file merge errors later, after having the project judges by CompSoc's committee members.
